      <h1>Bitcoin (BTC)</h1>
      <p>
        Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency, without a central bank or
        single administrator that can be sent from user to user on the
        peer-to-peer bitcoin network without the need for intermediaries.
        Transactions are verified by network nodes through cryptography and
        recorded in a public distributed ledger called a blockchain. Bitcoins
        are created as a reward for a process known as mining. They can be
        exchanged for other currencies, products, and services. Research
        produced by the University of Cambridge estimated that in 2017, there
        were 2.9 to 5.8 million unique users using a cryptocurrency wallet, most
        of them using bitcoin.

      <h1>Ethereum (ETH)</h1>
      <p>
        Ethereum is a decentralized, open-source blockchain featuring smart
        contract functionality. Ether is the native cryptocurrency of the
        platform. It is the second-largest cryptocurrency by market
        capitalization, after Bitcoin. Ethereum is the most actively used
        blockchain. Ethereum was proposed in 2013 by programmer Vitalik Buterin.
        Development was crowdfunded in 2014, and the network went live on 30
        July 2015, with 72 million coins premined. The Ethereum Virtual Machine
        (EVM) can execute Turing-complete scripts and run decentralized
        applications. Ethereum is used for decentralized finance, and has been
        utilized for many initial coin offerings.

      <h1>Ripple (XRP)</h1>
      <p>
        Ripple is a real-time gross settlement system, currency exchange and
        remittance network created by Ripple Labs Inc., a US-based technology
        company. Released in 2012, Ripple is built upon a distributed open
        source protocol, and supports tokens representing fiat currency,
        cryptocurrency, commodities, or other units of value such as frequent
        flier miles or mobile minutes. Ripple purports to enable "secure,
        instantly and nearly free global financial transactions of any size with
        no chargebacks." The ledger employs the native cryptocurrency known as
        XRP. In December 2020, Ripple Labs and two of its executives were sued
        by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for selling XRP
        tokens, which the SEC classified as unregistered securities.
